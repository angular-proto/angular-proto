# ng-proto

Angular's missing protocol for accessible UI.

ng-proto is a comprehensive suite of unstyled, accessible primitives for
Angular. Each component is meticulously designed for composability
and built on atomic behaviors that handle the hard parts—so you
can focus on building interfaces that are distinctly yours.

Build on our primitives. Or build your own.
Either way, you're building on protocol.
